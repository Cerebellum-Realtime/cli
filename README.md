# Cerebellum CLI

## Introduction

Cerebellum is a scalable, drop-in infrastructure and library for realtime applications. The Cerebellum CLI tool is used to deploy the ready-made infrastructure to AWS with just a few simple commands. Cerebellum's preconfigured [WebSocket Server](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Realtime/server.git) is the default configuration for simple and efficient time-to-deployment with the [Cerebellum SDK](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Realtime/clientSDK.git). If you prefer, you can use your own backend server by providing your image when prompted.

### Prerequisites

- an AWS account has been [created](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
- an AWS IAM role has been [created](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-set-up.html) with given `AdministratorAccess` permissions
  - the Access Key and Secret Access Key are required to connect to AWS
- `npm` is [installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-install)
- AWS CLI is [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configured
- AWS CDK is [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)
- SSL/TLS certificate has been validated and issued using [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)

### Installation

- run `npm install -g @cerebellum/cli`
- type `cerebellum --help` to see the available commands

### First Time Usage

Once installed, the `cerebellum` commands can be run by executing `cerebellum <command>` in your terminal.

For further detail on each command, type `cerebellum <command> --help` in the terminal.

Upon executing `cerebellum init` or `cerebellum create`, you will be prompted to provide some configurations for deployment:

- Your AWS Access Key
- Your AWS Secret Access Key
- Your preferred AWS region
- AWS description (can leave blank)
- Your dockerized image (if you intend to use your own server)
- Your validated SSL/TLS certificate ARN from AWS Certificate Manager
- Maximum and minimum number of concurrent remote servers for scaling up and down
  - Your infrastructure will automatically scale down to the minimum number of servers on low load
  - Your infrastructure will automatically scale up as the load increases until it reaches the approved maximum

## FAQ

<!-- faq -->

#### I canceled the `cerebellum create` (or `cerebellum init`) command while the infrastructure was still deploying, and now it won't let me redeploy. How can I fix this?

- The infrastructure will continue to deploy, even if you cancel the command during deployment. You may check in your [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) in the AWS console to see the logs.

#### I have been waiting for a really long time and it is still deploying. Is something wrong?

- Deployments to AWS can take up to 30 minutes. There is a lot of work AWS has to do behind the scenes to provision new resources or to drain existing resources.
- To troubleshoot, log in to your AWS console and check the logs in your [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). You will be able to discern which resource is holding up the deployment. Then, you may navigate to that resource and check its logs to further investigate.

#### I want to cancel my deployment, but it is still updating or deploying. How can I do this?

- If there are any errors, or if you wish to cancel the deployment, you can force delete the stack from [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) in the AWS console.

#### Does Cerebellum apply identifiers to the infrastructure that gets spun up by the CLI?

- Everything deployed using `cerebellum create` or `cerebellum init` has `Cerebellum` as a prefix on its identifier. You can change these manually in the CDK if you wish, but make sure they are uniquely named.
